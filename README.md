## 🧠 Model Overview
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Model training (Regression models)
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

## ▶️ How to Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Car_Prediction.ipynb
```

## 📦 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Car name
- Year
- Selling price (target)
- Present price
- Kms driven
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Owner

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Multiple models comparison
- Save & deploy model using Streamlit / Flask
```
